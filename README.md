My second project built using React.JS- A basic static page travel journal for the place's I've been to so far in my life. Learned how to use and implement props for the first time to create reusable components including using .map to combine my data together into a single object for further code consistency. Styled using CSS with the help of the original Figma design and added mobile responsiveness.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
